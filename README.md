Predicting Pacific herring spawn in the Howe Sound 

This study investigates environmental drivers, such as Sea Surface Temperature, lunar cycles, and photoperiod, that influence the timing of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) spawning in Howe Sound, British Columbia. Data from the Marine Stewardship Initiative (2021-2024) are used to identify correlations between these factors and spawn timing, focusing on their impact in Howe Sound. Pacific herring, known as Slhawt’ to the Squamish people, are a crucial species in the marine ecosystem, supporting the food web for marine life, including seabirds, fish, and mammals. The timing of their spawning, which aligns with plankton blooms, is vital for ecosystem health. Understanding these drivers will not only inform fisheries management but also supports the Squamish Nation’s stewardship of their traditional territories.
